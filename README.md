## Installation

### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/) installed
2. Choose “*Install Package*” from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X)
3. Select “*AppleScript Completions and Snippets*” and press `Enter`

### GitHub

1. Change to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory
2. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/AppleScript-Sublime-Text.git`

### Manual installation

1. Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
2. Unzip the files to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Usage

### Completions

Many commands can simply be triggered by completing a standard AppleScript command. Commands such as `try`, `if`, `repeat`, or `set` will create a code block. Use the `Tab` key to jump between input-fields.

### Snippets

There are several snippets included to generate license-texts enclosed in a comment. To trigger these, try the `comment` command with license names as parameter. You could, for example, use `comment:mit` to add an *MIT License* text, or `comment:gpl2` for the *GNU General Public License* in version 2.0. Use the `Tab` key to jump between input-fields.

You can directly address several Mac OS X applications to have them perform some action. For instance you can scaffold a script using `Mail:Send message`, telling Mail to send a message. You can use the `Tab` key to jump between recipient, subject and message fields. Other examples would be `System Preferences:Security` to open the according panel in System Preferences, or `iTunes:Open file` to play a piece of music in iTunes.

More examples:

* `Calendar:Add event`
* `Finder:Open location`
* `OS:Notification Message`
* `Safari:Open location`

### Build System

A build system works on Mac OS X only and should be available by default. To run your script press `⌘+B` or build from the *Tools* menu.
